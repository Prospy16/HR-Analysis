# #  HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Power BI

---

##  Introduction

This HR Analytics project focuses on evaluating current human resource practices within an organization using data-driven methods. The goal is to identify areas for improvement, monitor employee trends, and provide actionable recommendations that enhance workforce efficiency, employee satisfaction, and overall organizational performance.

Power BI was used to clean, model, and visualize the dataset. The final dashboard helps HR leaders make informed decisions through clear insights on employee demographics, retention, attrition, and compensation patterns.

---

##  Project Aim

To uncover critical insights in employee data that drive strategic HR decisions, including improving retention, reducing turnover, and ensuring pay equity. The project is designed to provide executives with a data-informed view of their workforce, allowing for proactive talent and cost management.

---

##  Project Description

This project delivers an in-depth analysis of employee demographics, attrition trends, salary structures, and department distribution. It includes:

- Retention analysis: who stays and why  
- Turnover analysis: who leaves, when, and from where  
- Salary analysis: patterns based on age, department, and gender  
- Workforce overview: total headcount, education levels, performance ratings

The result is a dynamic Power BI dashboard that allows HR leaders to explore these themes interactively and make evidence-based decisions.

---

##  Deliverables

- A fully interactive Power BI dashboard with four report pages  
- Key insights summary and visual scorecards  
- Strategic recommendations for HR decision-making  
- GitHub-hosted documentation and dashboard visuals  

---

##  Data Acquisition and Preparation

The dataset was sourced from a simulated HR database (Excel format) containing 8,950 employee records with attributes such as education level, gender, department, job role, performance rating, salary, and more.

**Steps taken:**

- Imported using **Get Data** in Power BI  
- Data cleaning performed in **Power Query**  
- Transformed column names and types 
- Ensured consistency across categorical variables 

---

##  Data Cleaning and Transformation

- Used "First Row as Headers" for structure  
- Applied the correct Data Type to ensure numeric/text accuracy     
- Grouped variables for dashboard slicing (e.g. age brackets, job levels)

---

## Data Analysis and Visualization

The Power BI dashboard includes four major pages:

###  Overview Page
Summarizes the companyâ€™s entire workforce: active vs. attrited employees, department sizes, and age distribution.

###  Retention Analysis
Shows active employee distribution by gender, education level, hiring trends (2015â€“2024), and performance scores. Highlights departments with the highest retention.

### Turnover Analysis
Details attrition counts, attrition by education, department, and gender. Tracks turnover trends over the years, with 2023 showing the highest exits.

###  Salary Analysis
Examines salary averages by department, gender, and age groups. Finds pay imbalances and cost-heavy segments in older age groups and IT teams.

##  Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Retention in Operations & High-Exit Roles**  
   Implement mentorship, internal mobility, and better workload distribution in Operations and among Inventory Specialists.

2. **Address Female Attrition**  
   Develop support policies like flexible scheduling, mentorship for women in leadership, and inclusive engagement programs.

3. **Upskill  Employees**  
   Invest in training and certifications to support career progression and reduce turnover among this group.

4. **Monitor Pay Equity & Conduct Succession Planning**  
   Conduct a compensation audit to assess gender-based pay gaps and prepare cost-effective successors for retiring high earners (56â€“69 yrs).

5. **Enhance Employee Engagement in High-Turnover Years**
   Since 2023 saw the highest turnover, conduct pulse surveys and exit interviews to uncover what changed in that period (e.g. policies, leadership, benefits).
